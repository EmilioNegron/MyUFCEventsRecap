# MyUFCEventsRecap
UFC Fighting Events Recap application used to showcase Android Architectural Components from JetPack

I have coded this app to highlight some of the powerful advantages to migrating an app to, or writing new apps, utilizing the latest and greatest Android JetPack Architectural components. I picked to list UFC Past Events, based on the TheSportsDB free Web Service. 

The following components/features are used in this app:

* The Retrofit networking library.
* The basic Android Architecture Components, ViewModel, ViewModelFactory, and LiveData.
* Transformations for a LiveData class.
* Building and launching a coroutine.
* Binding adapters in data binding.
* The Room database to create an offline cache.
* Using the repository Class to abstract an app's data layer from the rest of the app.
* How to load cached data using a repository.
* Use Workmanger Worker to update list of available events, using Constraints to monitor Network availability, as well as device battery charging, and set to execute during device idleness at once a day intervals.
* Navigation Destinations

Thanks for reading!!
